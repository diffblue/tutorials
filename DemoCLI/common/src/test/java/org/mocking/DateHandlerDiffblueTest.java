    //   Diffblue Cover was only able to write tests that are time-sensitive.
    //   The assertions don't pass when run at an alternate date, time, and
    //   timezone. Try refactoring the method to take a java.time.Clock instance so
    //   that the time can be parameterized during testing.
    //   See https://diff.blue/R031 for details.
